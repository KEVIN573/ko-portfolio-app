              I'm extremely passionate about helping small businesses and
              institutions improve their online presence. for instance, Nuru
              palace hotel had this <span>ðŸ‘‰</span>(
              <a href='https://nurupalacehotel.com'>
                https://nurupalacehotel.com
              </a>
              ) outdated, unresponsive and visually not appealing website, that
              I was able to redesign to this <span>ðŸ‘‰</span>(
              <a href='https://nurupalacehotel.netlify.com/'>
                https://nurupalacehotel.netlify.com/
              </a>
              ) and make it more professional and user friendly to their
              customers.
